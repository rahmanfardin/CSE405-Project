# CSE405 Mini Project: Apex University Network Design

## Project Overview

This project aims to design and implement a comprehensive network infrastructure for Apex University, encompassing multiple campuses and diverse networking needs. The network design incorporates both wired and wireless access, essential services (DNS, DHCP), and dynamic routing (OSPF) for efficient communication.

## Key Features

* **Web Presence:** The university's website (http://www.apex.edu.bd) is hosted and accessible from all campuses.
* **DNS Server:** A Domain Name System (DNS) server handles address resolution for the university's domain.
* **DHCP Server:** Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) automatically assigns IP addresses across campuses.
* **LAN Segmentation:** Each of the six campuses has its dedicated Local Area Network (LAN) with wired and wireless hosts.
* **Routing:** Six routers interconnect campuses, and the Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) protocol manages dynamic routing.
* **IP Addressing:** Network addresses from all three classes (A, B, C) are utilized.

## Design Considerations

* **Scalability:** The design allows for future expansion and growth of the network.
* **Server Room:** A dedicated server room LAN segment houses all servers for centralized management.

## Tools Used

* **Packet Tracer:**  Primary tool for network design and server implementation (recommended).
* **Other Necessary Tools:** Any additional tools as needed for configuration and testing.
